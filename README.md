# Truncheons & Flagons

The rules of the game were fairly simple, yet allowed for some subtlety.

There are three teams in a game of Truncheon & Flagons.
The Knights
The Fairies
The Goblins
Each team has three players.
Six flagons of ale, mead, or wine are be arranged on a table. Four flagons making the corners of a square, and the fifth and sixth being placed in the middle of the square. The table should be in an area of a tavern where the teams had some ability to move around.
Teams rotated between being the Knights, Fairies, and Goblins after each round.
The Knights have to throw a small wooden ball into one of the flagons. Each Knight has their own ball.
Each Knight that successfully throws a ball into a flagon earns 2 points for the Knights.
Each Knight that successfully throws a ball that lands on the table earns 1 point for the Knights.
The Goblins guard the flagons by swinging small truncheons to knock the ball out of the air before it landed in a flagon or on the table.
Each Goblin that successfully knocks a thrown wooden ball out of the air earns 1 point for the Goblins.
The Fairies can distract the Knights or the Goblins.
If a Fairy distract a Knight enough that a ball is dropped, or thrown out of the playing area, the Fairies receive 1 point.
If a Fairy distracts a Goblin enough so that a thrown ball lands anywhere in the playing area (on the table or in a flagon) without any defensive truncheon swings, the Fairies receive 1 point.
There are three rounds so that each team can play each role.
At the end of round three, whichever team has the most points earns the honor of drinking the contents of the six flagons.
